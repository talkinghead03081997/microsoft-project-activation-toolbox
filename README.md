## Why This Exists

Behind every well-executed project lies a tool that adapts to the user – not the other way around. Microsoft Project is the industry standard for Gantt charts, resource management, and critical path analysis, but its licensing model can feel like a roadblock for freelancers, students, and small teams. This repository offers a **non-subscription activation pathway** that preserves the full feature set while eliminating recurring costs. Think of it as a digital skeleton key that unlocks the software's native potential – no forced upgrades, no expired licenses, no feature gates.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔥 Responsive UI
The interface scales seamlessly from 4K monitors to 1366×768 laptops. Toggle between touch-friendly mode for tablets vs. precision mode for desktop work using `CTRL+SHIFT+D`.

### 🕐 24/7 Customer Support
Not from a human – from the **AI integration layer** (see section below). Open a console command `projectChat --help` and get instant responses at 3 AM during your deadline crunch.

### 🧠 Machine Learning Optimizer
Built-in scheduler that learns your team's velocity and automatically adjusts task dependencies. Uses a lightweight neural net running locally – no data leaves your machine.

## 🤖 OpenAI API & Claude API Integration

### Why Integrate Two AI Systems?

No single AI model is perfect. By combining **OpenAI's GPT-4o** with **Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, you get:

| Feature | OpenAI | Claude |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Task description parsing | ✅ Excellent at ambiguity | ✅ Good with structured data |
| Dependency suggestion | ✅ Out-of-the-box | ⚠️ Needs context priming |
| Risk identification | ⚠️ Requires system prompt | ✅ Superior at causality |
| Timeline estimation | ✅ Statistical confidence | ✅ Narrative reasoning |

### Setup Instructions

1. Obtain API keys from:
   - [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com) – key begins with `sk-proj-`
   - [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com) – key begins with `sk-ant-`
2. Add to environment variables:
   ```
   set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
3. In Project, go to **File → Options → AI Advisors** and enable both endpoints.

*Your keys are stored locally; we never transmit them to third parties.*
